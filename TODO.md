# TODO Tasks

* [ ] Addition of other descriptors like HOG, LBP, LIOP etc., as listed in the [Vlfeat C API](https://www.vlfeat.org/sandbox/api/index.html)
  * [x] HOG
  * [x] LBP
  * [ ] LIOP
  * [ ] FV
  * [ ] VLAD

* [ ] Adding tests for the package and adding CI/CD

* [ ] Better documentation - For now the functions are just listed in the README.md file. It would be better to have a separate documentation page. Example read-the-docs

* [ ] Publish as a pypi package rather than need to install it as a development package
